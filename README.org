* =projector=

=projector= manages the code repositories and build tasks that get your code into production.

** Recipes

*** =projector::pipeline=

The =pipeline= recipe iterates through items in a databag and constructs a pipeline to build and deploy a software project. The pipeline includes one =projector_repository= resource and one or more =projector_job= resources. The repository is configured to send to a queue when new code is pushed. The first job listens on the queue and triggers a build for each push. Any other jobs in the pipeline are triggered automatically as each preceding job completes successfully.

** Resources

** Resources

*** =projector_pipeline=

A pipeline is the path your code follows from =git commit= to production.

*** =projector_repository=

A repository stores and versions your code. =projector= manages the repository and configures hooks to trigger builds when your code changes.

*** =projector_job=

A job builds or deploys your code. Jobs are organized in a pipeline, where artifacts are promoted from one phase to the next. In each phase, the phase name (=target=) is passed to an executable when your job is run.
